          <p className="summary">A new American electric vehicle startup called Slate Auto has made its debut, and it’s about as anti-Tesla as it gets.

          It’s affordable, deeply customizable, and very analog. It has manual windows and it doesn’t come with a main infotainment screen. Heck, it isn’t even painted. It can also transform from a two-seater pickup to a five-seater SUV.</p>
